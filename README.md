#BooksHistory

##What is this?
This is a hobbyproject in Java. The goal is to create a desktop application that interacts with a database. Right now i am using embedded derby DB as my database.

##Functionality

The program will consist of a GUI where the user can enter and store data about their read books, (title, author, read year, comments etc.) The goal is that the application will be simple but yet a nice tool to save up books that you have read and information about them.

##Current state
At the moment the progam consist of a basic GUI where the mainframe is a list of all the books that the user have read and a menu where the user can add,delete or edit books.
The GUI is created with Java Swing.

##Stuff to do
This project is currently in version 1.0 and going to be put on hold for a while (i've got new projects im working on and I spend alot of time on my studies). I might take up this project again in the future and upgrade it a little! My main thoughts for upgrades right now is: Create options for the user to store information about more stuff than books (movies for example). And maybe add some statistic page.

##How do i use it?
In "src/main/resources/executeable" you can download zip files with either .exe version or .jar version. Enjoy!
